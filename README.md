# tictactoeagainstComputer

## First Java Project

- Grabbed the initial code from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tic-tac-toe-game-in-java/.

## Changes:

- Replaced 2nd Player with Computer
- Set Computer to initially pick a square randomly
- Set Computer to try to win if it notices two of 'Os' in a row and an empty spot in the line
- Set Computer to block Player's win, but it prioritizes its own victory condition before blocking
- Created several "Difficulty" options that Players can select that determine how often the AI will play "smart" vs putting an 'O' randomly
